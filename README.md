# Hi, I'm Ananta Sinha, Ph.D.

Transportation Data Scientist & Engineer | AI Researcher | Infrastructure Analyst

---

I'm a data-driven researcher with a strong foundation in machine learning, computer vision, and infrastructure systems. I have over 4 years of experience working with public agencies and research institutions to improve mobility, safety, and infrastructure resilience across the U.S.

## 🛠 What I Do
- Freight & Truck Data Analysis (WIM, Truck Parking, Freight Generators)
- AI/ML Applications in Transportation (XGBoost, LSTM, CNN, Computer Vision)
- Aerial Imagery-Based Roadway Feature Extraction (HRNet, OCRNet)
- Traffic Forecasting, Congestion Analysis, & TSMO Strategy Evaluation
- Infrastructure Risk & Reliability Modeling (Bridge Safety, Extreme Loads)

## 🛠  Projects
- **AI for Level of Traffic Stress (LTS):** Developed an aerial image-based pipeline using HRNet for national-scale multimodal routing.
- **Truck Parking Analysis – ARDOT:** Led spatial-temporal modeling of parking demand, supporting freight mobility and safety.
- **WIM-Based Risk Assessment:** Ph.D. research applying extreme value theory and prospect theory to overweight vehicle events.
- **TSMO Behavior Modeling – NCHRP:** Evaluating the impact of operational strategies (e.g., ramp metering) on traveler behavior.

## 🛠  Technical Skills
- **Languages & Tools:** Python, PyTorch, SQL, ArcGIS, MATLAB, C++, PySpark
- **ML/AI:** XGBoost, CatBoost, LSTM, CNN, Computer Vision, Generative AI
- **Geospatial:** ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Aerial/OSM data processing
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
