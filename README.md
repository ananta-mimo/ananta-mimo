# Hi, I'm Ananta Sinha, Ph.D.

Transportation Data Scientist & Engineer | AI Researcher | Infrastructure Analyst

---

I'm a data-driven researcher with a strong foundation in machine learning, computer vision, and infrastructure systems. I have over 4 years of experience working with public agencies and research institutions to improve mobility, safety, and infrastructure resilience across the U.S.

## 🛠 What I Do

- **AI/ML for Infrastructure:** Deep learning for bridge reliability forecasting and roadway image segmentation (HRNet, CNNs, OCRNet).
- **Behavioral Modeling:** Built yield rate evaluation tools using logistic regression and statistical testing to assess pedestrian-driver interactions by treatment and speed environment.
- **Multimodal Planning & Routing:** Developed LTS scoring models using aerial imagery and OpenStreetMap, integrated into routing systems for pedestrian/bike safety.
- **TSMO & Congestion Analytics:** Modeled travel behavior responses to ramp metering, managed lanes, and 511 systems; created congestion dashboards using INRIX and Replica data.
- **Freight & Truck Data Analysis:** Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) data forecasting, overweight vehicle risk assessment, truck parking demand, and freight generator modeling (e.g., logging industry impacts).


## 🛠  Projects
- **LTS Image Segmentation & Routing (USDOT SBIR):** Built a production-ready pipeline for extracting bike/ped safety features from aerial imagery and generating low-stress travel routes.
- **Yield Behavior Analysis (FDOT):** Built a Python-based analysis tool for estimating yield rates by crossing type and roadway characteristics using field data and regression models.
- **Truck Parking Study (ARDOT):** Conducted spatial-temporal modeling of parking demand across high-volume freight corridors.
- **WIM-Based Bridge Reliability Forecasting:** Combined machine learning and prospect theory to estimate failure probabilities under high-impact truck loads.
- **TSMO Impact Modeling (NCHRP):** Led efforts to quantify how operational strategies influence user behavior, travel choices, and congestion.

## 🛠  Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, MATLAB, R
- **ML/AI:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, CNN, LSTM
- **Data Tools:** Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, Spark, GeoPandas, Tableau
- **GIS:** ArcGIS Pro, aerial imagery analysis, OSM data integration
- **Big Data:** INRIX, Replica, WIM, Neo4j, Azure
